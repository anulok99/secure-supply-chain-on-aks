- [Coptaic](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic) patches container images using reports from vulnerability scanners
- [Notary](https://github.com/notaryproject/notary) signs container images with digital signatures
- [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library) policy enforcement for Kubernetes
